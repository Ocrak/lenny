**Lenny** is a fork of a link aggregator — [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy). Sadly, it only exist because of disrespectful behavior of the original author.

To maintain stability, this fork has a little no changes, but:
- the main reason, completely removed “slur filter” — the ugliest way to block words;
- little bit cleaned up UI — removed “sponsors” page and useless right-down panel;
- a new default theme — Pleroma, based on light theme of the [Pleroma project](https://pleroma.social);
- a muffin logo (by [MLP Vector Club](https://mlpvector.club)).
