**Lenny** is a fork of a link aggregator — [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy). Sadly, it only exist because of disrespectful behavior of the original author.

To maintain stability, this fork has a little no changes, but:
- the main reason, completely removed “slur filter” — the ugliest way to block words;
- a bit cleaned up UI — removed “sponsors” page and useless right-down panel;
- a new default theme — Pleroma, based on light theme of the [Pleroma project](https://pleroma.social);
- ~~allowed `<sub>text</sub>` and `<sup>text</sup>` HTML tags as `~text~` and `^text^`~~ upstreamed!;
- a muffin logo (by [MLP Vector Club](https://mlpvector.club)).

> We are never going to remove the slur filter completely (or add an option to that effect), because we dont want to make it easy for right-wingers to use Lemmy. We can talk about removing or changing specific words, but in general I dont think there is anything wrong with writing “b*tch” or something like that.

> I’ll have to think about this. Hard-coding it means I don’t have to do a database migration every time someone comes up with a new slur. And putting it in a DB table means someone could very easily remove it by deleting every row of that table, which isn’t good. I want to make it very difficult for racist trolls to use the most updated version of Lemmy.

This is bullshit.

# Development

The easiest way to build this project is using Podman (or Docker).

Take a look at [`shtripok/rust-musl-builder`](https://hub.docker.com/r/shtripok/rust-musl-builder) container. You can use it both in coding process and building production images.

Here is an example how to setup a coding environment:

```bash
git clone https://moonbutt.science/innereq/containers/lenny && cd lenny
podman pull shtripok/rust-musl-builder:arm
podman run -v ./:/home/rust/src:Z shtripok/rust-musl-builder:arm /bin/bash
cd server && cargo build
```

To build a production container image:

```bash
podman build -t lenny -f ./docker/prod/Dockerfile .
```

To use public container registry:

```bash
podman pull quay.io/innereq/lenny
```
